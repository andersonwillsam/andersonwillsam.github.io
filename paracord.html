          I believe that...<br/><br/>

          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
          For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,<br/>
          that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.<br/><br/>

          -John 3:16 NIV<br/><br/>

          I believe in God, the Father almighty,<br/>
            creator of heaven and earth.<br/><br/>

          I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,<br/>
              who was conceived by the Holy Spirit<br/>
              and born of the virgin Mary.<br/>
              He suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br/>
              was crucified, died, and was buried;<br/>
              he descended to hell.<br/>
              The third day he rose again from the dead.<br/>
              He ascended to heaven<br/>
              and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty.<br/>
              From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.<br/><br/>

          I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br/>
              the holy catholic church,<br/>
              the communion of saints,<br/>
              the forgiveness of sins,<br/>
              the resurrection of the body,<br/>
              and the life everlasting. Amen.<br/><br/>

          - The Apostels Creed<br/><br/>
